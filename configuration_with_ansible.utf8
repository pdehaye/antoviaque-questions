SITUATION
=========

We want to use the configuration repo for setting up and configuring our machines.

We had (some) success with changing values in the folders

     playbooks/roles/<rolename>/vars/

for the different roles. But we don't have much experience with variable precedence
 and in particular with parametrized variables putting directly in the initial
 playbook and the 'secure_dir' variable.

QUESTION
========

CONFIGURATION.1: We would ideally like to have some properties with our use
                 of the configuration repo:
                   - having all changes (variables etc.) made to the configuration
                      within one or two files or directory. (or two with 'secure_dir')
                   - (if possible) also only having to call one playbook.

                  This would give us independence of the generic edx repo
                  in terms of development/testing/documentation and be like
                  an "internal use plugin".

                  Do you know if some kind of playbook or config-file/dir is possible?
                  If yes, can you describe how to setup such a "plugin playbook"?
